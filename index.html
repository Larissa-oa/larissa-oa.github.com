  <h1>Hello, I'm Larissa</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website!I guess you want to hear more about me.</p>
  <h2>From cooking up gourmet dishes to crafting sleek code, I'm on a journey from the kitchen to the keyboard! Trading in my chef’s knife for a laptop, I’m diving into the world of web development with the same passion and creativity that fueled my culinary career. Whether it’s perfecting a recipe or debugging a line of code, I’m all about making things work—beautifully. My sidekick? Baileys, the French bulldog who’s mastered the art of napping while I master full-stack development. Ready to turn up the heat in tech! 👩‍💻🐾</h2>
